        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I am Ikedichukwu Kennedy Ozor, a passionate web developer with a solid foundation in software engineering. I graduated with a second class upper degree from the American University of Nigeria, where I honed my skills and developed a deep appreciation for crafting efficient and user-friendly software solutions.

        <p>
            My journey in software engineering has equipped me with a diverse set of skills, including proficiency in front-end and back-end technologies. I thrive on turning creative ideas into functional and visually appealing web applications. My dedication to staying updated with the latest industry trends and technologies ensures that I deliver cutting-edge solutions to meet the evolving needs of clients and users.

                <h3>SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout my journey, I've proudly contributed to 23 impactful projects, showcasing my prowess in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI/UX designing, and C#.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My expertise extends beyond mere coding; it encompasses the art of designing visually captivating interfaces with a meticulous focus on enhancing user experiences. As a dedicated Full Stack Engineer, I seamlessly navigate the complexities of both front-end and back-end development, employing C# to establish robust server-side logic.

            <div class="grid-item">
                <h3>DATA SCIENTIST</h3>
                <p>
                    In my toolkit, Python is the magic wand I wield to craft data-driven solutions. Whether it's diving into complex datasets, spotting patterns, or creating visual narratives, I thrive in the realm of Data Analysis and Visualization.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research is my compass in this ever-expanding field, guiding me to explore new methodologies and stay on the cutting edge of data trends. Beyond just numbers, I see data as a strategic asset. Aligning insights with business strategies is where I find my sweet spot, making data not just insightful but actionable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it's not just about the data; it's about people too. I excel in Stakeholder Management, breaking down complex findings into bite-sized insights that resonate with diverse audiences. I've found that effective communication is the key to turning data into decisions that everyone can embrace.
